# Contributing Guidelines

Hi! we are really excited that you are interested in contributing to Sleek. Before submitting your contribution though, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines.

- [Issue Reporting Guidelines](#issue-reporting-guidelines)
- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)
- [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines)
- [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

We use GitHub Issues as the official bug tracker for the Sleek Dashboard. Please Search [existing issues](https://github.com/tafcoder/sleek-dashboard/issues). Itâ€™s possible someone has already reported the same problem.
If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, [open a new issue](https://github.com/tafcoder/sleek-dashboard/issues)

## Pull Request Guidelines

- The `master` branch is basically just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branches. **Do not submit PRs against the `master` branch.**

- Work in the `src` folder.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - Commit messages should follow the [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines) so that changelogs can be automatically generated..

- If adding new feature:
  - Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.

- If fixing a bug:
  - If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxxx[,#xxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log, e.g. `update entities encoding/decoding (fix #3899)`.
  - Provide detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.  But also,
we use the git commit messages to **generate the change log**.

### Full Message Format

A commit message consists of a **header**, **body** and **footer**.  The header has a **type** and **subject**:

``` c
<type>: <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory.

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:` , followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

### Subject (Mandatory)

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Body (Not Mandatory)

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer (Not Mandatory)

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

#### Examples

Messages must be matched by the following regex:

``` js
/^(revert: )?(feat|fix|polish|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|workflow|ci|chore|types)(\(.+\))?: .{1,50}/
```

To add "Features" :

``` c
feat: add 'comments' option
```

To make "Bug Fixes" with a link to issue #28:

``` c
fix: handle events on blur

close #28
```

To make "Performance Improvements" and under "Breaking Changes" with the breaking change explanation:

``` c
perf: improve time consuming by removing 'foo' option

BREAKING CHANGE: The 'foo' option has been removed.
```

The following commit and commit `667ecc1` do not appear in the changelog if they are under the same release. If not, the revert commit appears under the "Reverts" header.

``` c
revert: feat: add 'comments' option

This reverts commit 667ecc1654a317a13331b17617d973392f415f02.
```
